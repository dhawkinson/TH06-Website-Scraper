# TH06-Website-Scraper
Full Stack Java Script Project 06 - Treehouse TechDegree

Imagine you work for a price comparison website.

Youâ€™ve been given the task to create a Node.js command line application that goes to an ecommerce site to get the latest prices and save them to a spreadsheet (CSV format). You will write the application as if the spreadsheet will be used by another application to populate a database. The application you build will run once every day.

## Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following 2 ways:
<ol>
    <li>Edit your package.json file so that your program runs when the npm start command is run.</li>
    <li>When an error occurs, log it to a file named scraper-error.log . It should append to the bottom of the file with a time stamp and error e.g. [Tue Feb 16 2016 10:02:12 GMT-0800 (PST)] <error message></li>
</ol>
